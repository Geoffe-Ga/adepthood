#
# Ralph's picker for adepthood (Geoffe-Ga/adepthood). Prints the
# lowest-numbered open issue that is a real, unblocked, not-already-in-flight
# implementation issue — or nothing if the backlog is drained.
#
# The picker is label-configurable. Tune via env vars:
#
#   RALPH_REQUIRE_LABELS  Space-separated labels an issue MUST have (ALL of
#                         them). Empty (default) = no required label; any open
#                         issue is a candidate.
#   RALPH_EXCLUDE_LABELS  Space-separated labels that DISQUALIFY an issue.
#                         Default excludes housekeeping / deferred / in-flight
#                         markers. Override to taste.
#
# Eligibility:
#   - open
#   - has every label in RALPH_REQUIRE_LABELS (if any)
#   - has none of the labels in RALPH_EXCLUDE_LABELS
#   - not already addressed by an open PR (`Closes|Fixes|Resolves #N` in body)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — issue number printed (or nothing if backlog empty / drained)
#   2 — gh CLI not authenticated / missing
