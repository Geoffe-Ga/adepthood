"""Turn one ZAP JSON report into SARIF that GitHub code scanning will accept.

The nightly deep scan writes a single JSON file on a runner and then the runner
goes away. Two things read it afterwards, and neither can read the other's
format: GitHub code scanning speaks SARIF only, and the remediation loop consumes
the raw artifact. This module is the bridge, and it is deliberately the only
piece of the nightly job written in Python -- everything a test can execute is
better than anything a test can only grep for.

WHY NOT ZAP'S OWN SARIF TEMPLATE: the report the pinned action guarantees to
write is ``report_json.json``, unconditionally, into the workspace. Asking the
container for a second format means passing more options through the action's
``cmd_options``, where a typo produces no file and no error -- and an absent
SARIF file uploads as nothing and renders as a clean Security tab. Converting
the file that is always there keeps one report, two consumers, and one failure
mode: unreadable, which is loud.

THE FAILURE MODE THIS GUARDS: an empty SARIF run is perfectly valid, uploads
without complaint, and looks exactly like a scan that found nothing. So a report
that cannot be read -- absent, truncated, or not a ZAP report at all -- exits
with the harness-error code the rest of this package uses rather than
converting to zero results. A run that proved nothing must never be mistaken for
a run that found nothing.

Usage:

    python -m scripts.dast.zap_sarif --report report_json.json \
        --sarif report_sarif.sarif

Stdout carries a Markdown summary and nothing else -- the workflow appends it
straight to ``$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`` -- so every diagnostic goes to stderr.

Exit codes:
    0 — the report was read and converted. Findings do not change this: the
        nightly scan reports, it does not block.
    3 — the report could not be read. Deliberately the same "harness error" code
        the rest of this package uses.
